# What is a CutScene?

A cutscene is a non-playable or live-action animation, usually employed as a storytelling device. Cutscenes have not or have very limited gameplay, like dialogues or comic book panes. 

# Types of cutscenes

Cutscenes are divided on Interactive or No-Interactive. Inside this division, each cutscene can be: 

## 1. Live-action

Scenes recorded in real-live, like television or films. 

These type of cutscenes are not common nowadays, but they were a big novelty when the saga of 16-bits consoles was put on the market. They revolutionized the market, as at that moment it was like watching a film or the television while playing a video game. 
Live-action cutscenes are generally known for being filmed on a low budget with unprofessional actors and poor dialogue. 

Command and Conquer saga is known for having live-action cutscenes with famous actors like Tim Curry, J.K Simmons and Jonathan Pryce. 
The cutscenes on C&C are very profesional and they are a reference.

###### Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 

Dragon's Lair is known for being a interactive live-action cutscene transformed into a video game. The player interacts with the cutscene to play the game.

## 2. Animated

Pre-rendered scenes or rendered in-game. 

### 2.1. Real-Time cutscene

Real-time cutscenes are the ones being rendered for the game engine while playing. Video games like Assassinâ€™s Creed have really good real-time cutscenes, which let the player see what is happening at that moment in the game while watching the scene.

###### Assassin's Creed: Origins

Quick Time Events (QTE) is an example of real-time cutscenes. These ones let the player interact with the scene while he is watching it, making him to be alert of what is happening and putting himself on the character shoes. In order to do this, the scene is pre-rendered or automatically in-game set, so the player only needs to press some buttons or keys in certain moments of the scene. Normally, if the player does not follow the instructions the game makes him do, he would have to repeat the scene as the objective is not achieved. This means that if the game is launched in console and in PC, the interaction on the scenes need to fit on both. 

God of War is a good example on how to use QTE. When Kratos is fighting against giant creatures, to give the sensation of enormity and do not lose the power of being fighting, the player only needs to press certain buttons that appear on the screen to kill the creature.

### 2.2 Pre-rendered cutscene

These scenes are usually made in a different studio than the one that makes the game. This allows more modern computer animation techniques and no problems with the video game software. The quality of the scenes created is usually really high, as a cinematic. Years ago, cutscene quality compared to the in-game one was very wide. As the years have gone by, and the industry keeps improving, the difference is every time smaller. 
One clear example of pre-rendered cutscenes is Halo 5. The first thing the player sees while starting the campaign is this [cutscene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7DKY-ykK0M). Then there is a transition from the cutscene to the gameplay and it is easy to see that there is quality difference between both.
