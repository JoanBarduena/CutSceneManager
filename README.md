# What is a CutScene?

A cutscene is a non-playable or live-action animation, usually employed as a storytelling device. Cutscenes have not or have very limited gameplay, like dialogues or comic book panes. 

# Types of cutscenes

There are two main types of cutscenes: 

- Animated cutscenes. Scenes pre-rendered. 

- Live-action cutscenes. Scenes recorded in real-live, like television or films. 

Each group can be set on a bigger group, being the scene Interactive or No-Interactive.
